## Weekend Project

To consolidate this week's learning, complete the following project:

1. Create a GitHub repository for your project
2. Add all group members as collaborators
3. Create a README.md file with a comprehensive project description
4. Use the `ts-playground` as a foundation or develop a new application from scratch using Next.js
5. Design a page with a single input field for `.txt` file uploads
   - Users should upload a book or similar content with characters and settings
6. Implement a button to **extract characters** from the uploaded file
7. Develop a RAG pipeline to extract characters from the uploaded file
   - Each character should have a name, description, and personality
8. Add a text area below the button to display the results
9. Convert the output from the AI into an array of objects and present it in a table format
   - (optional) Modify the `retrieveandquery.ts` file to use _Structured Outputs_ to make it easier to process the response
10. Integrate the `ts-playground` project with the `story-telling-app` to enable users to create new stories using imported characters, reusing their descriptions and personalities inside the stories being generated by the AI
11. Submit your project through the designated submission form
